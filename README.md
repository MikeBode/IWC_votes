# IWC_votes
Voting behaviour of national member states of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), during their annual meetings. Data set currently extends from 1991-2018, and also includes the 1982 moratorium vote (Amendment to Schedule, paragraph 10(e)).  

Primary data includes a datasheet recording of all national voting positions across all analysed years (IWC-Compiled-Voting-Data-1982-2018.csv). Also contains individual voting adjacency matrices for every vote across this period (IWC-DecisionXXX.csv), indicating agreement between different countries (i.e., they either voted "yes" together, voted "no" together, or voted "abstain" together).
